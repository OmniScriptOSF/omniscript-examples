  # Welcome to OmniScript v1.1!

  This document showcases all the **new formatting capabilities** added in version 1.1.

  ## What's New in v1.1

  We've added powerful new formatting options while maintaining **100% backward compatibility** with v1.0.
}

@slide {
  title: "✨ New Text Formatting";
  
  Text styling now includes strikethrough:
  
  - **Bold text** for emphasis
  - *Italic text* for subtlety  
  - __Underlined text__ for highlights
  - ~~Strikethrough text~~ for deletions
  
  > Perfect for showing price changes, corrections, and revisions!
}

@slide {
  title: "📝 Ordered Lists";
  
  Create numbered lists with automatic sequencing:
  
  1. First step - Plan your document
  2. Second step - Write in OSF format
  3. Third step - Export to your target format
  4. Fourth step - ~~Manually format~~ Enjoy automatic formatting!
  
  > Ordered lists make instructions crystal clear.
}

@slide {
  title: "💬 Blockquotes";
  
  Emphasize important information with blockquotes:
  
  > "OmniScript has transformed how we handle documentation. 
  > The new v1.1 features make it even better!"
  > — Sarah Chen, Technical Writer
  
  Perfect for:
  - Customer testimonials
  - Important warnings
  - Featured quotes
  - Key takeaways
}

@slide {
  title: "💻 Code Blocks";
  
  Display code with proper formatting and syntax highlighting:
  
  ```typescript
  import { parse, serialize } from 'omniscript-parser';
  
  const doc = parse(osfContent);
  const output = serialize(doc);
  ```
  
  Supports all major languages with preserved indentation!
}

@slide {
  title: "🎯 Real-World Example";
  
  ## Product Pricing Updates
  
  Our pricing has been optimized:
  
  1. ~~Starter Plan: $29/month~~ **Now $19/month**
  2. ~~Pro Plan: $99/month~~ **Now $79/month**
  3. Enterprise: Contact sales *(no change)*
  
  > "Best value in the market!" - Industry Analyst
  
  Implementation code:
  
  ```javascript
  const pricing = {
    starter: 19,  // was 29
    pro: 79       // was 99
  };
  ```
}

@slide {
  title: "🔐 Security Improvements";
  
  v1.1 also includes important security enhancements:
  
  - ✅ HTML XSS prevention (all output sanitized)
  - ✅ Unterminated string detection
  - ✅ Enhanced input validation
  
  Your documents are safer than ever!
}

@doc {
  ## Unicode Support

  v1.1 adds full unicode escape sequence support:

  - Checkmarks: ✓ ✔ ✗ ✘
  - Arrows: → ← ↑ ↓
  - Symbols: © ® ™ €
  - Emoji: 🎉 🚀 ✨ 🔒

  All these characters serialize correctly and maintain fidelity through parse/serialize cycles.

  ## Position Tracking

  Error messages now pinpoint exact locations:

  ```
  Error: Missing closing } for block meta at 15:42
  Error: Expected identifier starting with a letter at 8:5
  Error: Invalid number format at 12:18
  ```

  Makes debugging **10x faster**!

  ## Try It Yourself

  Use this document to test all v1.1 features:

  ```bash
  # Render to HTML with new formatting
  osf render v1.1-new-features.osf --output showcase.html
  
  # Export to Markdown with preserved formatting
  osf export v1.1-new-features.osf --target md --output showcase.md
  
  # Generate PDF with all features
  osf render v1.1-new-features.osf --format pdf --output showcase.pdf
  ```

  Happy documenting with OmniScript v1.1! 🚀
