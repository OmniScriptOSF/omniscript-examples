  title: "Smart Sync in Action";
  layout: TitleAndContent;
  
  ## How It Works
  
  **Traditional Sync**:
  - Uploads entire 100 MB file
  - Takes 2-3 minutes on typical connection
  - Uses full bandwidth
  
  **Smart Sync** (v3.0):
  - Detects only 2 MB actually changed
  - Uploads only changed blocks
  - **Completes in 5 seconds**
  - **97% bandwidth saved**
  
  *Perfect for large files: videos, CAD files, databases*
