  2. **Service Layer**: Business logic microservices
  3. **Data Layer**: Databases, caching, message queues
  4. **Platform Layer**: Monitoring, logging, CI/CD
  
  ## 2.2 Core Components
  
  ### API Gateway
  
  - Technology: **Kong**
  - Responsibilities: Routing, authentication, rate limiting
  - Throughput: 50,000 req/sec
  - Latency: p99 < 50ms
  
  ### Service Mesh
  
  - Technology: **Istio**
  - Features: Service discovery, load balancing, circuit breaking
  - mTLS encryption between all services
  
  ### Database Layer
  
  - **PostgreSQL 17** for transactional data
  - **MongoDB 8** for document storage
  - **Redis 8** for caching and session management

  # 4. Design Patterns
  
  ## 4.1 Service Communication
  
  Services communicate using:
  
  - **Synchronous**: REST/GraphQL for user-facing APIs
  - **Asynchronous**: Message queues for background tasks
  - **Real-time**: WebSockets for live updates
  
  ## 4.2 Data Consistency
  
  We employ **eventual consistency** with:
  
  - Event sourcing for critical workflows
  - SAGA pattern for distributed transactions
  - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
  
  ## 4.3 Resilience Patterns
  
  - Circuit breakers (via Istio)
  - Retry with exponential backoff
  - Bulkheads and timeouts
  - Graceful degradation

  # 5. Security Architecture
  
  ## 5.1 Authentication & Authorization
  
  - **Protocol**: OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect
  - **Token Type**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
  - **MFA**: Required for production access
  
  ## 5.2 Network Security
  
  - **Zero Trust** architecture
  - mTLS between all services
  - Network segmentation via Kubernetes NetworkPolicies
  - Web Application Firewall (WAF)
  
  ## 5.3 Data Security
  
  - Encryption at rest (AES-256)
  - Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
  - Key management via HashiCorp Vault
  - Regular security audits

  # 6. Performance Metrics
  
  ## 6.1 Current Performance
  
  - **Throughput**: 10M requests/day
  - **Latency**: p50 < 20ms, p99 < 100ms
  - **Uptime**: 99.99% (4 nines)
  - **Error Rate**: < 0.01%
  
  ## 6.2 Scalability
  
  The platform automatically scales based on:
  
  - CPU utilization (target: 70%)
  - Memory usage (target: 80%)
  - Request queue depth
  - Custom metrics (e.g., message queue length)

  # 7. Deployment Strategy
  
  ## 7.1 CI/CD Pipeline
  
  1. **Build**: Automated on every commit
  2. **Test**: Unit, integration, E2E tests
  3. **Security Scan**: Dependency and container scanning
  4. **Deploy**: Blue-green deployment to production
  
  ## 7.2 Rollout Process
  
  - **Canary deployment**: 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%
  - **Automated rollback** on error rate spike
  - **Feature flags** for gradual feature rollout

  # 8. Monitoring & Alerting
  
  ## 8.1 Key Metrics
  
  - Request rate, latency, error rate (RED method)
  - CPU, memory, disk, network (USE method)
  - Business metrics (signups, orders, revenue)
  
  ## 8.2 Alert Levels
  
  - **P1 (Critical)**: Production down, immediate response
  - **P2 (High)**: Performance degradation, respond within 1 hour
  - **P3 (Medium)**: Non-critical issues, respond next business day
